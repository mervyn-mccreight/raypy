# RayPy

## Background
RayPy is a basic ray-tracer written in python. This program has been developed by me and my classmate [Tim Pauls](https://www.github.com/timpauls) as a voluntary task during 
the [photorealism and simulation course](http://cg.viswiz.de/?courses.fosim.index) (given by [Prof. Dr. Christian-A. Bohn](http://cg.viswiz.de/?contact.cab.index)).

As this was just an explorative task during an university course, none of the code does and wants to give any guarantee of correction.
